# CPSC-483-Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
Projects completed for CPSC 483 Introduction to Machine Learning Course at CSUF during the fall 2021 Semester.
Completed by myself, and my team member Zachary Serna.

Project 1 consisted of familiarize ourselves with Python and Jupyter by implementing some rudimentary algorithms for outlier detection.

Project 2, in this project we used NumPy to implement vectorized linear and polynomial regression models and compare their performance using separate training and test sets.

Project 3 consisted of using scikit-learn,  a higher-level machine learning library that works with NumPy data, and Pandas, a library that makes it easier to manipulate data. 
We explored a variety of classification algorithms, and compare their performance on a “real-world” dataset.
